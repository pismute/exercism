# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.

- If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 2, 4, **7**, 14.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 15.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 only has two factors- 2 and 17.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that,
    so it just goes with the straightforward "34".


To run the tests:

```sh
$ gradle test
```
