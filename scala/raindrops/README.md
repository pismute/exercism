# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's factors.

- If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 2, 4, **7**, 14.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 15.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 only has two factors- 2 and 17.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that,
    so it just goes with the straightforward "34".

The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

For more detailed info about the Scala track see the [help
page](http://exercism.io/languages/scala).
